                            programming. The main learning principle of this course is “what if…”: children try things

                            "Programming with SPIKE Prime" is developed on the basis of the Spike Prime set - new
                            products of 2020 from LEGO Education. It opens up opportunities for fun learning programming
                            and robotics using the easy-to-understand Scratch 3.0 - like programming environment. </p>

                        <p class="course_info_p"> Students will master basic programming skills, learn to program in
                            block diagrams and understand how to operate variables. <br>Children will create programs
                            for various robot missions. <br>Understand the technical features of electronic components
                            (color sensor, force sensor, ultrasound sensor, gyroscope, servomotor) and design and
                            program their own robots. <br>They will improve communication and presentation skills, learn
                            to distribute and perform various roles in the team. <a href="learn_more" class="den_btn"
