                        As a result of learning, children will gain knowledge about the operation and structure of a large number of devices and mechanisms, develop the skill to independently design robots, and program them using visual programming language. They will also develop the skills of programming algorithms creation, the division of tasks into separate steps, work planning, and the ability to share duties within the working group.

Students will do some new creative tasks to better understand and use means of composition. Inventors will also discover the architecture of different countries and times, and plunge into the world of modern architecture. We will continue to develop skills of drawing sketches and parti diagrams in sketchbooks. Increased number of creative lessons allows us to fulfill most of the students’ potential and embody their most daring ideas with LEGO®.

                        Children will be able to create their own projects using the given mean of composition, apply the Fibonacci numbers to create a building, structure, or ensemble. Future architects will learn the features and periods of styles, deepen knowledge of each of the composition means, discover volumetric-spatial composition, explore new architectural elements that are not typical of European countries. Children will improve the ability to work not only in pairs but also in teams, share duties depending on their skills and abilities. They will learn to appreciate their projects and works of others.
